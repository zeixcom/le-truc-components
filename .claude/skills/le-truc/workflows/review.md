## Step 1: Read the component

Read all files for the component being reviewed:
- `.ts` — component definition
- `.html` — inner markup and example states
- `.css` — styles
- `.md` — documentation (if present)

Do not propose changes to code you have not read.

## Step 2: Check the TypeScript

Work through references/anti-patterns.md and flag any violations. Also check:

- **Props type**: every reactive property is explicitly typed; no implicit `any`
- **UI type**: every key returned by `select` has a type; `HTMLElement` subtypes used where selector allows inference
- **Parsers**: attribute-driven props use a parser from `asString`/`asBoolean`/`asInteger`/`asNumber`/`asEnum`/`asJSON`; DOM-initialised props use `read(reader, fallback)`. Custom parsers wrapped with `asParser()`.
- **Effects**: each effect targets the right element; `on()` handlers that only update `host` use the return-object shortcut; handlers that do more return `void`
- **Custom effects**: every custom effect function returns a cleanup function
- **Coordination**: `pass()` used only for Le Truc-to-Le Truc bindings; `setProperty()` used for all others (see references/coordination.md)

## Step 3: Check the HTML

- Native semantic elements used inside the custom element
- Markup is valid and functional without JavaScript (progressive enhancement)
- All meaningful states and variant combinations are represented as separate examples
- No inline styles or inline event handlers

## Step 4: Check the CSS

- All rules scoped to the host element tag name
- CSS nesting used for descendant selectors
- Design-token custom properties used for all colors, spacing, and typography
- Variant styles expressed as modifier classes on the host, not as separate selectors

## Step 5: Check accessibility

Follow references/accessibility.md for the widget type. Verify:
- Correct ARIA role on the appropriate element (or native element used instead)
- Interactive ARIA states (`aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, etc.) kept in sync via `toggleAttribute`/`setAttribute` effects
- Focus management is correct for the pattern (dialogs, menus, tabs)
- Labels are present and associated

## Step 6: Check documentation

If a `.md` file is present, verify it covers the sections required by references/documentation.md for this component's feature set (properties, attributes, CSS classes, descendants, methods, events as applicable). Types and defaults must match the TypeScript source.

## Step 7: Report

Summarise findings in three categories:
- **Must fix**: correctness issues, anti-patterns, broken accessibility
- **Should fix**: missing documentation, suboptimal coordination patterns
- **Optional**: style suggestions only worth making if the author asks
</process>

<success_criteria>
- No violations from references/anti-patterns.md
- ARIA and semantics correct for the widget type
- Correct coordination mechanism in use
- Documentation complete and accurate
</success_criteria>
